CURRENT LIMITATIONS & NEXT STEPS:
----------------------------------

[TODO] CROSSING DETECTION IMPROVEMENTS:
   Priority: HIGH - Core functionality enhancement

   Current Issue:
   - Only detects simple zone transitions (A → B)
   - No direction tracking or complete crossing detection
   - Missing duration measurement and completion verification

   Recommended Implementation (Option B - Statistical Approach):
   1. Add directional zones:
      - Sidewalk1, Sidewalk2, Sidewalk3, Sidewalk4
      - Road1, Road2, Road3, Road4
      - Keep existing crosswalk zone

   2. Enhanced transition logging:
      - Log every zone entry/exit with timestamps
      - Track zone sequences: Sidewalk1 → Crosswalk → Sidewalk3
      - Calculate crossing duration from first entry to final exit

   3. Post-processing correlation:
      - Identify complete crossings from transition sequences
      - Determine direction based on entry/exit zones
      - Generate summary crossing events with duration

   Expected Log Format:
   {
     "timestamp": "2025-09-19 16:47:44",
     "crossing_type": "pedestrian_crossing",
     "direction": "north_to_south",
     "duration_seconds": 4.2,
     "object_type": "person",
     "crossing_start": "2025-09-19 16:47:40",
     "crossing_end": "2025-09-19 16:47:44"
   }

[TODO] ZONE CONFIGURATION ENHANCEMENTS:
   Priority: MEDIUM - Support for new crossing logic

   1. Add directional zone support to metasettings.py
   2. Update find_borders.py to handle multiple zones efficiently
   3. Create zone templates for common crosswalk layouts
   4. Add zone validation and ordering checks

[TODO] TRACKING RELIABILITY IMPROVEMENTS:
   Priority: MEDIUM - Better object persistence

   1. Improve ID consistency across zone transitions
   2. Add speed-based trajectory prediction for gaps
   3. Handle partial occlusion better during crossings
   4. Consider multiple detection hypothesis tracking

[TODO] ANALYTICS & REPORTING:
   Priority: LOW - Data insights

   1. Enhanced analyze_crossings.py with direction analysis
   2. Peak hour traffic analysis
   3. Safety metrics (near-misses, crossing speeds)
   4. Export to CSV/Excel for external analysis

[TODO] PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
   Priority: LOW - System efficiency

   1. Optimize YOLO inference frequency (every N frames)
   2. Add GPU acceleration support for YOLO
   3. Implement frame skipping during low activity
   4. Memory usage optimization for long-running sessions


TECHNICAL DEBT & CODE CLEANUP:
-------------------------------

[CLEANUP] Code Organization:
   - Consider splitting crosswalk_detector.py into multiple modules
   - Extract YOLO processing into separate class
   - Improve error handling and logging consistency

[CLEANUP] Documentation:
   - Add inline documentation for YOLO integration
   - Create setup/installation guide
   - Document zone configuration best practices

[CLEANUP] Testing:
   - Add unit tests for detection merging logic
   - Create test data for YOLO coordinate mapping
   - Validate tracking behavior with known scenarios
